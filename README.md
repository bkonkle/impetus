# Impetus

This repo is my attempt at playing around with [MobX](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/).  The end product
is a _very_ pale imitation of the [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) plugin
for Chrome.

## Installation & Dev startup
```
> npm install
> npm start
```

## Production build
If you want to run this app somewhere, just do `npm run build` and stick the contents of the `/build` folder somewhere.
